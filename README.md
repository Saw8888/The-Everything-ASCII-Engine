# The-Everything-ASCII-Engine

The Everything ASCII Engine is an attempt to make a console based clone of games such as Powder Toy and Noita. It is still heavily in development. Its quite inefficient but im working on it :).
The only innovative thing is the use of a RLE algorithm to draw quicker to the console.

Use 1,2,3 to chage material.
Use W,A,S,D to move
Use SPACE to place items
